# Downgrade iTheme Guide

This guide involves downgrading your Vivo **Themes** app to an older version that supports custom fonts and themes. Newer versions (7.0 and above) block custom content, so we need to go back to an older version.

## Why Downgrade?

-   **Themes app version 7+**: Blocks all custom themes and fonts
-   **Older Themes versions**: Allow custom themes and fonts to work
-   **The Problem**: Vivo intentionally removed custom font support in newer updates

## How It Works

zFont 3 will:

1.  Check your current Themes app version
2.  Find a compatible older version for your device
3.  Create a special script to downgrade your Themes app
4.  Help you run the script using different methods

## Methods to Run the Script

You have **2 main options** to downgrade:

### Option 1: ADB (No Root Required)

**What is ADB?** A tool that lets you control your phone from a computer or special apps.

**Ways to use ADB:**

-   **Computer**: Install ADB tools on Windows/Mac/Linux
-   **Android Apps**: Brevent, ADB OTG, Bugjaeger
-   **zFont 3**: Uses Shizuku to run ADB automatically

### Option 2: ROOT (Full Access)

**What is ROOT?** Full admin access to your phone's system.

-   Can downgrade any app
-   Works on all Android versions
-   Requires rooted phone

## Important Limitations

### Android 13+ Restrictions

-   **Android 13 and newer**: Google blocked ADB from downgrading system apps
-   **ADB methods won't work** on Android 13+
-   **ROOT still works** on all Android versions

### What This Means:

-   **Android 12 and older**: ADB methods work fine
-   **Android 13 and newer**: You MUST have ROOT access to downgrade

## If Downgrade Doesn't Work

### Alternative Method

If you can't downgrade Themes app to version 6.8.1.1 or earlier:

-   Try the **File Manager & Documents method** (see other guide)
-   This method may work on some devices
-   Success is not guaranteed

### Not Our Fault

**Please understand:**

-   zFont 3 is just a tool - it doesn't create the restrictions
-   Vivo intentionally blocks custom fonts in newer versions
-   This is **Vivo's decision**, not a problem with zFont
-   **Don't leave negative reviews** asking for "old zFont back"
-   The old zFont app can't work either due to the same Vivo restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### Downgrade Fails

-   Your Android version might be too new (13+)
-   Try the ROOT method if available
-   Consider the File Manager method instead

## Need Help?

1.  **First**: Check your Android version - ADB only works on Android 12 and older
2.  **Second**: Make sure you followed all setup steps correctly
3.  **Third**: Try different ADB apps or methods
4.  **Last**: Consider asking Vivo to officially support custom fonts again

----------

::: danger Remember
The best solution is to contact Vivo and ask them to bring back official custom font support in their Themes app.
