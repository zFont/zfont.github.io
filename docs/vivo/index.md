zFont 3 is only guaranteed to support devices running Android 11 and earlier.
On Android 12 and later, zFont may not work reliably on vivo & iQOO devices.

For devices running Android 10 and later, you will need to downgrade your **Themes** app.
To do this, refer to the [Downgrade](downgrade.html) guide.

For Android 12 and newer devices, try the [File Manager & Documents](exploit.html) method to apply fonts and themes on vivo & iQOO devices.
Please note that this method is not guaranteed to work on all devices.
