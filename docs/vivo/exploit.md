# Apply using File Manager & Documents

Vivo phones don't normally allow custom fonts and themes from outside sources. This guide shows you how to work around this limitation using special apps and a step-by-step process.

**Important:** This method requires patience and careful following of steps. It's currently the only way to use custom fonts without downgrading your Themes app.

## Why Do We Need This?

### The Problem

-   **Old Vivo phones** stored themes in a folder you could access: `/sdcard/.dwd/c/o/m/b/b/k/t/h/e/m/e`
-   **New Vivo phones** (Themes app version 7 and newer) store themes in a protected folder: `/data/bbkcore/theme/.dwd`
-   Regular users cannot write to this protected folder
-   Only special Vivo system apps can access it

### The Solution

We found 2 Vivo apps that can access the protected folder:

1.  **Vivo File Manager**
2.  **Vivo Documents**

Using these apps, we can modify downloaded themes with our custom fonts.
